Avoided Question 6:

```
Task 6: Implement Constraints

Add the following constraints to your schema:
- Prevent enrolling students in a course if it has reached its capacity.
- Ensure each student can enroll in a maximum of 5 courses.
```

*Because I've never done something similar, and don't know how to do it.*

# Schemas

All schemas are from the *given exercise*, **nothing modified**.

# Data

All data was generated **using an AI** with all schemas given to respect the data formats.

# Queries

All queries where done by **me** and **verified by an AI** with a prompt similar to this:

***Don't give me a solution, don't fix any code, don't say explicit anwsers, only guide me to fixig the following SQL Query if there is any errors.***

That way, only something similar to a correct or wrong was given, no additionnal details other than what would be given by an SQL engine.

###### The real prompt is long and has been tested by me in the past
